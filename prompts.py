"""
This module defines the setup for interacting with a Neo4j graph database by providing 
predefined Cypher query templates and examples, designed for use with a language model 
that generates responses based on structured prompts. It encapsulates configurations 
for generating precise, schema-aware Cypher queries in response to natural language questions.

Key Components:
- `description_query`: A comprehensive Cypher query template for retrieving detailed 
  context about movies or persons within the graph, including their related entities.
- `prefix`, `suffix`, `examples`: These elements define the structure and examples for 
  constructing few-shot learning prompts that guide the language model to generate 
  syntactically correct and contextually appropriate Cypher queries.
- `agent_system_prompt`: Provides a detailed directive for the language model, ensuring 
  responses are consistently derived from the database and adhere to specific user queries.

Functionality:
- These configurations facilitate the creation of a knowledgeable assistant capable of 
  transforming user queries into actionable Cypher statements, and ensuring all interactions 
  are grounded in the database content.

Usage:
- The setup is ideal for applications requiring dynamic and accurate access to a graph database 
  through natural language interfaces, such as chatbots or interactive data exploration tools.
